Control Rusclimate devices managed by the **Hommyn** app (Ballu, Electrolux and others sold by
Rusclimate) directly from Home Assistant: over your **local network**, through the **vendor cloud**,
or both with automatic fallback.

Supported devices:

- **Ballu ONEAIR ASP-100 / Electrolux EASP-100** breezer (Hommyn device type 69) — local and cloud.
- **Ballu ONEAIR ASP-200S** breezer (Hommyn device type 59) — cloud only, see
  [Entities (ASP-200S)](#entities-asp-200s).

[Русская версия](README.ru.md)

## Features

- **Two channels, one device.** Local UDP (the same encrypted protocol the app uses on your Wi-Fi)
  and the vendor's MQTT cloud. Both deliver changes within a fraction of a second.
- **Connection mode per device:**
  - **Auto** (default) — local first; if the local session drops, commands and state switch to the
    cloud at once and come back when the local channel recovers. A command that is not confirmed by
    the device within 3 seconds is retried once through the other channel.
  - **Local only** — never talks to the cloud; works without internet.
  - **Cloud only** — for devices on another network.
- The Hommyn app keeps working alongside Home Assistant.
- Devices on your network are discovered automatically.
- If a device has not been reachable over the local network for 30 minutes, a warning appears in
  **Settings → Repairs** and clears itself once the local connection is back.

## Entities (ASP-100)

| Entity | What it does |
|---|---|
| Climate | On/off, presets (manual, night, turbo, ventilation; auto only when a CO₂ sensor is fitted), fan speed 1–7, heater set point 5–25 °C. Switching on restores the last mode, like the app. |
| Supply air temperature | Air temperature after the heater |
| CO₂ | Only available when the optional sensor is fitted |
| Filter | Remaining filter resource, % |
| Turbo ends | When the 15-minute turbo run finishes |
| Sound | Built-in ambient sounds: rain, sea, forest, birds, fireplace |
| Button sound, Backlight auto-off | Device settings |
| Problem | On when the device reports an error code |
| Connection | Which channel carries the device now: local, cloud or offline (diagnostic) |
| Signal strength | Wi-Fi RSSI (diagnostic, disabled by default) |

## Entities (ASP-200S)

The same climate, supply air temperature, CO₂, filter, turbo, button sound, backlight, problem,
connection and signal entities as the ASP-100, with these differences:

| Entity | What it does |
|---|---|
| Climate | Fan speed 1–8 (turbo runs at 9, which is not a selectable speed). Setting a speed in auto switches the device to manual. |
| PM2.5 | Particulate matter, µg/m³ |
| Pre-filter | Remaining pre-filter resource, % (the main filter is **Filter**) |
| Ionizer, UV lamp | Air purification switches |
| Damper | Open/close; available **in manual mode only** — in the other modes the device drives the damper itself and ignores the command |

There is no Sound select: the ambient sounds are not verified on this model.

## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2026.9 or newer.
- For the local channel: Home Assistant and the device on the same network segment (mDNS must reach
  Home Assistant).

## Installation

HACS → ⋮ → Custom repositories → add this repository as an *Integration* → install
**Rusclimate (Hommyn)** → restart Home Assistant.

## Setup

1. In the Hommyn app open the device → **Settings → Access control → Share** and press **Share**
   under the QR code. Copy the link — it looks like
   `rusklimat://device-share/rusclimate/69/<mac>?token=…`.
2. In Home Assistant: **Settings → Devices & services**. A discovered device shows up there — press
   **Add** and paste its link. Or use **Add integration → Rusclimate (Hommyn)**.
3. Choose the connection mode.

One share link per device. The room from the link becomes the device's suggested area.

## Options

**Configure** on the integration entry changes the connection mode. **Reconfigure** accepts a new share
link for the same device (for example after the device was re-added in the app).

## Using it

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Breezer: night mode at 23:00"
    triggers:
      - trigger: time
        at: "23:00:00"
    actions:
      - action: climate.set_preset_mode
        target:
          entity_id: climate.bedroom_breezer
        data:
          preset_mode: night
```

## Security and privacy

- **The share link is a password.** Its token alone lets anyone control the device through the vendor
  cloud. Home Assistant stores it in the config entry; diagnostics redact it.
- The cloud channel logs in with the Hommyn app's built-in credentials (the same for every app user)
  and a unique client id, exactly as the app does. The local channel needs no internet.
- Commands are never sent as retained MQTT messages.

## Troubleshooting

- **Connection shows "cloud" in Auto** — Home Assistant does not see the device's mDNS announcement
  (`_syncleo._udp`). Check that both are on the same network segment and multicast is not filtered.
- **Device unavailable in Cloud only after an HA restart** — the vendor broker keeps a stale "offline"
  flag for some devices until the device sends a fresh update; change anything on the device or use
  Auto.
- Download diagnostics from the device page when reporting an issue.

## Known limitations

- **ASP-200S works through the cloud only.** The local codec is verified on the ASP-100; for device
  type 59 the connection mode is always Cloud, whatever is chosen. Checked live on module firmware
  1.21: speed, modes, ionizer and damper commands; the UV lamp command and the ventilation preset are
  not verified yet.

- Night mode always runs at speed 1, as in the Hommyn app: the device has no separate night speed
  setting (checked on ASP-100, module firmware 1.38). Setting any speed leaves night mode.

## How it works

The device announces itself over mDNS; its UDP port and X25519 key change on every reboot, so the
integration follows the announcements and reconnects. The local session (X25519 + AES-CBC, built on
[pysyncleo](https://github.com/DeKaN/pysyncleo)) and the cloud MQTT session both push state; in Auto
the active channel is the source of truth and the other one fills in only what the active channel does
not report (for example Wi-Fi latency from the cloud).

and [alimp01/hass-hommyn](https://github.com/alimp01/hass-hommyn), who mapped the protocols.

## Development

```bash
python3.14 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r requirements_test.txt
.venv/bin/pytest tests -q
```

`custom_components/rusclimate/api/` has no Home Assistant imports and is tested on its own in
`tests/pure`.
